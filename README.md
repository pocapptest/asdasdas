Your instructions seem to be asking for a completely different code, unrelated to the Fibonacci sequence in Python. You're asking for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application in Node.js. Here's a basic example using Express and an array as the data store:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

let data = [];

// Create
app.post('/data', (req, res) => {
    data.push(req.body);
    res.send('Data added successfully');
});

// Read
app.get('/data', (req, res) => {
    res.json(data);
});

// Update
app.put('/data/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    const newData = req.body;
    data[id] = newData;
    res.send(`Data at id ${id} has been updated`);
});

// Delete
app.delete('/data/:id', (req, res) => {
    const id = req.params.id;
    data.splice(id, 1);
    res.send(`Data at id ${id} has been deleted`);
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`));

This code creates a simple server that can handle CRUD operations on an array called `data`. Note that this is a very basic example and doesn't include any error handling or data validation, which you would want to add in a real application. Also, in a real application, you would typically use a database rather than an array to store your data.
